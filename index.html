			<h3>Data Analyst bootcamp / Case Western Reserve University / 2020/7-present</h3>

				Project manager with B.S. Electrical Engineering from Michigan State University, and currently taking Data Analytics boot camp at Case Western Reserve University. Enjoys leveraging background and skill set to support detailed and efficient analysis. Recently completed a project in a team of three using data sets from Kaggle.com , and used Python to visualize crime dead in each age group vs gender, threat level, and city type. These data allow to determine who and where are most likely to have crime from 2016 to 2019. Strengths including analytical problem solving abilities combined with collaborating across diverse groups, makes me a valuable addition to any team.
